# 💡 Smart Pricing & Retention: Data-Driven Solutions for Airbnb and Telecom Industries

### 📘 Overview
This repository showcases two end-to-end **machine learning projects** focused on solving real-world business problems using Python and data-driven techniques — one for **Airbnb pricing prediction** and another for **telecom customer retention**.

---

## 🏡 Project 1: Airbnb Price Prediction

**Objective:**  
Build a regression model to predict Airbnb listing prices based on property features such as location, room type, and availability.

**Key Highlights:**
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Regression model implementation (Linear, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest)  
- Model performance evaluation using R², MAE, and RMSE

## 📞 Project 2: Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

**Objective:**  
Develop a classification model to predict customer churn and help telecom companies reduce customer loss.

**Key Highlights:**
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and correlation study  
- Machine learning models — Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest  
- Performance metrics — Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score  

**Notebook:**
